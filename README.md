## Publish

The Publish Plugin decouples the timing of data updates in the QOR Admin interface from the display of data on the frontend of the website which QOR Admin is backing. A [GORM-backend](https://github.com/moisespsena-go/aorm) model can be withheld from frontend display until it is "published".
